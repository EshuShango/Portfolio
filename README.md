### Description:
Here is a basic portfolio of mine with examples of my suppoesed work

## Things I learned
- Flexbox is powerful, but takes time to learn its many features

- Be mindful of the small details 

- Working with Images can be tough

- Take time to observe the code and one thing at a time


## Task 
- created a portfolio to show my work
- created a README file

## Roadmap
as I continue to learn more I will refactor my portfolio to be more professional
